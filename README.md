## 📘 Project Description

This project is part of my **MTech dissertation** at **MNIT Jaipur**. Over the past **2 years**, I have been actively working in the field of **rainfall analysis and forecasting** using **Python**, **machine learning**, and **TensorFlow**. This project focuses on analyzing and predicting long-term rainfall behavior in two major climate regions of Rajasthan, India – the **Jaipur Division (semi-arid)** and **Jodhpur Division (arid)**.

---

### 🎯 Objectives:
- To detect long-term **rainfall trends** (monthly, seasonal, yearly) using **Mann-Kendall test** and **Z-statistics**
- To develop and validate a **rainfall forecasting model** using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
- To forecast future rainfall for the years **2025 (completed)** and extend forecasting up to **2035 (ongoing)**

---

### 🧪 Methodology:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Daily rainfall data from **1980 to 2020** obtained from **IMD**
   - Aggregated to monthly, seasonal, and yearly formats

2. **Trend Analysis:**
   - **Mann-Kendall non-parametric test** used to assess trends
   - **Z-statistic** used for significance testing
   - Classified trends into increasing, decreasing, or no significant trend

3. **Forecasting with ANN:**
   - Model trained on **1980–2012**, validated on **2013–2020**
   - Forecast generated for **2025**, and in progress till **2035**
   - Implemented using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **scikit-learn**

---

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies:
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow)
- Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
- Excel for validation and tabulation

---

### 📈 Key Outputs:
- District-level rainfall trend reports and Z-value summaries
- Monthly and yearly rainfall forecast charts
- CSV files for trends and future rainfall estimates
- Clean and reproducible Python notebooks

---

### 🌍 Applications:
- Useful for **climate trend monitoring**, **drought risk assessment**, and **agriculture planning**
- Can be extended to other Indian states or broader South Asian regions
- Provides a basis for **early warning systems** in water-scarce regions
